            Given a sorted array arr[] and a value X, find the k closest elements to X in arr[].
            
            A simple solution is to do linear search for k closest elements.
            1.  Start from the first element and search for the crossover point (The point before which elements
            are smaller than or equal to X and after which elements are greater). This takes O(n) time
            2.  Once we find the crossover point, we can compare elements on both sides of the crossover point to
            print k closest elements. This step takes O(k) time.
